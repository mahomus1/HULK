# Mizzou GI Schedule

This project displays weekly schedules for the University of Missouri Division of Gastroenterology & Hepatology. The `index.html` file reads CSV data for each week and renders a table.

## Mobile layout

When the screen width is 768&nbsp;px or less a compact layout is used. AM and PM duties are stacked inside each cell with a tiny divider. PGY information is shown inline with the fellow name. Rotation names are abbreviated for Orientation (`Ori`) and all holidays (`ðŸŽ†`).
