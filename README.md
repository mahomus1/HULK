# Mizzou GI Schedule

This project displays weekly schedules for the University of Missouri Division of Gastroenterology & Hepatology. The `index.html` file reads CSV data for each week and renders a table.

## Mobile layout

When viewed on screens narrower than 768&nbsp;px each day collapses into a single column. AM and PM duties are stacked with a small divider for clarity. PGY information is shown as a badge next to the fellow's name instead of its own column.
