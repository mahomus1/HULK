# Mizzou GI Schedule

This project displays weekly schedules for the University of Missouri Division of Gastroenterology & Hepatology. The `index.html` file reads CSV data for each week and renders a table.

## Compact view

A "View Mode" selector appears next to the week selector. Choose **Compact** to reduce font sizes and remove sticky columns so the entire table fits on small screens. Switch back to **Standard** for the default layout.
